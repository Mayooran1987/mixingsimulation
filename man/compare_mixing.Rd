\title{The graphical comparison between different mixing schemes with varying parameters of mixing by simulation results.}
\usage{
compare_mixing(n_iter, mu, sigma, b, k, distribution)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_iter}{number of iterations}

\item{mu}{average number of colony-forming units in a primary sample which is in logarithmic scale if we use a lognormal distribution}

\item{sigma}{log standard deviation of the colony-forming units in a primary sample}

\item{b}{concentration parameter}

\item{k}{number of small portions/ primary samples}

\item{distribution}{what suitable distribution type we have employed for simulation such as 'Poisson-fair' or 'Poisson-beta' or 'Lognormal-fair' or 'Lognormal-beta'}
}
\value{
graphical comparison between different mixing schemes
}
\description{
This function provides the graphical displays for a different set of mixing plans for comparison purpose. (to be finished later on)
}
\details{
Let \eqn{N'} be the number of colony-forming units in the mixed sample which is produced by mixing of \eqn{k} primary sample and \eqn{N' = \sum(N_i)}  and \eqn{i} be the number of colony-forming units in the \eqn{i^{th}} primary sample; where \eqn{i = 1,2,....k} and \eqn{y_i=x_i/\sum(x_i) = q_i/Q}; where \eqn{x_i} follows \eqn{gamma (b,1)} (to be finished later on)
\itemize{
\item Case 1 (Poisson-fair): \eqn{N_i} follows \eqn{Poisson(\mu)}
\item Case 2 (Poisson-beta): \eqn{N_i} follows \eqn{Poisson(\mu*y_i)}
\item Case 3 (Lognormal-fair): \eqn{N_i} follows \eqn{Binomial(M_i,1/k)}; where  \eqn{M_i} follows \eqn{Lognormal(\mu, \sigma)}
\item Case 4 (Lognormal-beta): \eqn{N_i}  follows \eqn{Binomial(M_i,y_i)}; where  \eqn{M_i} follows \eqn{Lognormal(\mu, \sigma)}
