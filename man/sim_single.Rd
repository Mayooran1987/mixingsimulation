\title{The total number of colony-forming units in the mixed sample by simulation result (in the single mixing plan).}
\usage{
sim_single(n_iter, mu, sigma, b, k, distribution, summary = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_iter}{number of iterations}

\item{mu}{average number of colony-forming units in a primary sample which is in logarithmic scale if we use a lognormal distribution}

\item{sigma}{log standard deviation of the colony-forming units in a primary sample}

\item{b}{concentration parameter}

\item{k}{number of small portions/ primary samples}

\item{distribution}{what suitable distribution type we have employed for simulation such as 'Poisson-Type A' or 'Poisson-Type B' or 'Lognormal-Type A' or 'Lognormal-Type B'}

\item{summary}{if we need to get the mean and standard deviation of simulated \eqn{N'}, use summary = TRUE ( default summary =FALSE).}
}
\value{
total number of colony forming units in the single mixing plan
}
\description{
This function calculates the resulting total number of colony forming units in the mixed sample in the single mixing plan. (to be finished later on)
}
\details{
Let \eqn{N'} be the number of colony-forming units in the mixed sample which is produced by mixing of \eqn{k} primary sample and \eqn{N' = \sum(N_i)} (to be finished later on)
}
\examples{
n_iter <- 200000
mu <- 100
sigma <- 0.8
b <- 0.1
k <- 10
sim_single( n_iter, mu, sigma, b, k, distribution = "Poisson-Type A", summary = TRUE)
